# 42KL Born2beroot


1. To check if SSH service is started  `(sudo) service ssh status`
2. To check if UFW service is started `(sudo) service ufw status`
3. To enable UFW `sudo ufw enable`
4. To check UFW port rules `sudo ufw status numbered`
5. To change the default port for SSH
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config 
   
   sudo service ssh restart
   ```
   change #Port 22 to Port 4242 or any other port (yes remove that #)
6. To check if the default port is set `sudo grep Port /etc/ssh/ssh_config`
7. After Step 4, to delete a rule numbered <number> in UFW `sudo ufw delete <number>`
8. To add back a rule e.g. 4242 `sudo ufw allow <4242>`
9. To check if sudo program is properly installed `sudo` a help message should pop up
10. To view partition `lsblk`
11. To add a <user> `sudo adduser <user>`
12. To verify if <user> is created `getent passwd <user>`
13. To create a new <group> `sudo addgroup <group>`
14. To add <user> into a group `sudo adduser <user> <group> OR sudo usermod -aG  <group> <user>`
15. To check if <user> is in a <group> `getent <group> <user>`
16. To view all users in a group `getent group`
17. To switch user `sudo su - <user>`
18. To check current hostname `hostnamectl`
19. To change hostname to <new_hostname>
    ```
    hostnamectl set-hostname <new_hostname>
    sudo nano /etc/hosts
    
    127.0.0.1 localhost
    127.0.1.1 <new_hostname>
    ```
13. To go back to login page `exit`
14. To reboot VM `sudo reboot`
15. To change password policy 'sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-password' reboot to take effect
16. To change password expiration 'sudo nano /etc/login.defs' reboot to take effect
17. What is a cron job? 
    ```
    A cron job is a Linux command used for scheduling tasks to be executed sometime in the future. This is
    normally used to schedule a job that is executed periodically â€“ for example, to send out a notice every
    morning.
    ```
    
### To set up cron job    

1. To set up cron job, add a `<name>.sh` (monitoring.sh for this project)  file in `/usr/local/bin/` for a bash script
2. In Born2BeRoot, place the following bash script in the created <name>.sh file
    ```
    #!/bin/bash
    wall $'#Architecture: ' `hostnamectl | grep "Operating System" | cut -d ' ' -f5- ` `awk -F':' '/
    ^model name/ {print $2}' /proc/cpuinfo | uniq | sed -e 's/^[ \t]*//'` `arch` \
    $'\n#CPU physical: '`cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor | wc -l` \
    $'\n#vCPU:  '`cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep processor | wc -l` \
    $'\n'`free -m | awk 'NR==2{printf "#Memory Usage: %s/%sMB (%.2f%%)", $3,$2,$3*100/$2 }'` \
    $'\n'`df -h | awk '$NF=="/"{printf "#Disk Usage: %d/%dGB (%s)", $3,$2,$5}'` \
    $'\n'`top -bn1 | grep load | awk '{printf "#CPU Load: %.2f\n", $(NF-2)}'` \
    $'\n#Last boot: ' `who -b | awk '{print $3" "$4" "$5}'` \
    $'\n#LVM use: ' `lsblk |grep lvm | awk '{if ($1) {print "yes";exit;} else {print "no"} }'` \
    $'\n#Connection TCP:' `netstat -an | grep ESTABLISHED |  wc -l` \
    $'\n#User log: ' `who | cut -d " " -f 1 | sort -u | wc -l` \
    $'\nNetwork: IP ' `hostname -I`"("`ip a | grep link/ether | awk '{print $2}'`")" \
    $'\n#Sudo:  ' `grep 'sudo ' /var/log/auth.log | wc -l`
    ```
3. To add the rule that script would execute without sudo password `sudo visudo`<br/>
   Add this line `your_username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh`
4. To edit the timing for cron job interval `sudo crontab -u root -e` 
   The scheduled tasks are structured as `[minute] [hour] [day_of_month] [month] [day_of_week] [command_to_run]`<br/>
   E.g. `*/10 * * * * /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh` for it to run every 10 mins
5. By default, cron job cannot run in second interval (fastest is once a minute). To bypass that limiation and have cron job to run in seconds interval, make cron job with the same cron job but the second one delayed by a certain interval. <br/> 
    E.g. to run monitoring.sh at 20 seconds interval,
    ```
    a. * * * * * bash /usr/local/bin/monitoring.s
       (at the first minute)
    b. * * * * * sleep 20; bash /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh_ 
       (at the first minute also but sleep for 20 seconds first before running the script)
    c. * * * * * sleep 40; bash /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh_ 
       (at the first minute also but sleep for 40 seconds to let a and b run first)
    
    In total it would have run 3 same scripts in a minute, each delayed by 20s than the 
    previous to look as if the cron job is running 20s once.
    ```
6. To stop cron job without editing the crontab `sudo systemctl stop cron`. To enable back `sudo systemctl start cron`
